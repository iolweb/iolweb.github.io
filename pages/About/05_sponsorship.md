![Call for sponsors](/images/spons.png)

The International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL) is seeking partners and sponsors to help grow the Olympiad globally.  The IOL has several sponsorship options and this is a wonderful opportunity to align your brand with the next generation of linguistic problem-solvers. We aim to keep registration fees low for all participating countries and encourage new countries to join.

Please get in touch with Lori Levin ([levin@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:levin@andrew.cmu.edu)) or Cara Greene ([cara.greene@adaptcentre.ie](mailto:cara.greene@adaptcentre.ie)) if you or your organisation would like to sponsor the IOL or support your local Olympiad.
