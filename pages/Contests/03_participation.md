Each participating country sends 1-2 teams of four contestants each.  The methods of choosing these contestants and composing the teams differ from country to country; in most cases a country's contestants are chosen from the winners of their national Linguistics Olympiad. Check [here](/local_organizers/) to find out how contestants are chosen in your country.

### What do I need to do to prepare?

No prior knowledge is necessary to compete at the IOL: every problem is self-contained.

The best preparation possible is to attempt as many past problems as you can.  Start with the [samples](/problems/samples/) if you're new to IOL problems and when you're ready take a stab at our [past problems](/problems/by_year/).  If you've done all those and can't get enough, the [national olympiads](#by_country) below also keep archives of past problems.

### What if my country doesn't participate?

* If you are an organization interesting in setting up a national contest and sending a team: contact us via [this form](/contact/).

* If you are a student interested in competing: We might know teachers in your country who are willing to help you assemble a team.  Ask a teacher or parent to [contact us](/contact/)

Note that the IOL is a contest for secondary-school students; current university students are ineligible to compete.
