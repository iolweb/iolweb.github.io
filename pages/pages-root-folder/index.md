# Welcome to the IOL

The IOL is one of 13 International Science Olympiads for secondary school students, and has been held annually since 2003. Each year, teams of young linguists from around the world gather and test their minds against the world's toughest puzzles in language and linguistics.

No prior knowledge of linguistics or languages is required: even the hardest problems require only your logical ability, patient work, and willingness to think around corners. Give some of our [past problems](/problems/by_year/) a try!

### Ventspils 2021
The 18th IOL, hosted by Ventspils, Latvia, has successfully concluded on July 23th, 2021. Due to the ongoing worldwide pandemic, contestants remotely competed in their countries. A total of 216 contestants of 54 teams representing 34 countries competed in IOL 2021, making it the biggest competition in the history of IOL, in terms of the number of contestants. You can find more information <a href="https://www.ioling.org/2021">here</a>.

<!-- ## Announcement (April 2nd, 2021)
From the Local Organizing Committee of the 18th IOL

Due to these unpredictable times and taking into account safety measures applied in Latvia, IOL 2021 will be held remotely, with no teams able to attend in person.
The exact amount of participation fees and registration deadlines will be determined in a week or two.

We thank you for the patience and look forward to having you online with us on July 19-23, when one of the most exciting events of the summer will take place! Opening and closing ceremonies will be streamed online, but for the individual and team competitions, teams must meet in a single location and will be invigilated by a person appointed by the Jury.
