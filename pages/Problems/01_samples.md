If the puzzle on Ancient Greek below "looks Greek to you", don't panic – we guarantee that _no previous knowledge_ of Greek is necessary to solve it.

All of the information you need to solve the puzzles below is in the puzzles themselves. All you need to add is some analytical reasoning and tricky thinking.

Once you've mastered these puzzles from national-level competition, why not try your skills against our [past international-level problems](/problems/by_year/)? They're difficult enough to puzzle professional linguists... but still solvable by secondary-school students.
