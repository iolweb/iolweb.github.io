From the Board of the IOL

At its most recent meeting, the Board reconfirmed its decision from last November to go ahead with this summer's event in Ventspils, Latvia, as much as travel and other restrictions permit. Any teams prevented from attending in person, either by their own or Latvia's travel rules, will be permitted to participate remotely, as long as they can convene in their own country.
