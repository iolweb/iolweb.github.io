I'd like to give a little background to this, and also invite more non-european delegations in. <a href="http://international-linguistics-olympiad.blogspot.com.au/p/contact.html">If you can help, be in touch.</a>&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">This is something I've thought a lot about before, and it was recently brought to the forefront of my mind by&nbsp;<a href="https://lnnonews.wordpress.com/2017/04/25/relief-as-registration-closes-before-any-african-countries-sign-up/">the funny blog post&nbsp;</a>"<span style="background-color: white; color: #323232;"><a href="https://lnnonews.wordpress.com/2017/04/25/relief-as-registration-closes-before-any-african-countries-sign-up/">Relief As Registration Closes Before Any African Countries Sign&nbsp;Up" by the satire blog Linguistics Olympiad News Network (yes, we're apparently famous enough to spawn satire and memes).</a></span></span></span><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: white; color: #323232;"><i><span style="font-family: inherit;">After the announcement of the countries participating in IOL in Dublin, there was relief visible on the faces of the IOL Problem Committee, who had been waiting in dread at the possibility of a team from Africa going to the competition.</span></i></span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: white; color: #323232;"><i><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;[...]</span></i></span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: white; color: #323232;">&nbsp;In an LNNO exclusive, IOL media correspondent&nbsp;</span><span class="fn" style="background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #323232; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">Hedvig Skirgård told us about the last minute panic&nbsp;when Simona Klemenčič opened her email account to see a registration request from a linguistics professor at the University of Dar es Salaam. She told us, “Having consulted with the problem committee who had written three out of the five problems on languages from Tanzania, we regrettably realised that the deadline for registration happened to fall just prior to the email. We wish Tanzania all the best for Prague 2018.”&nbsp;</span></span></i></div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><i><span class="fn" style="background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #323232; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></span></i><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: #323232;"><span style="background-color: white;">The blog post was very funny, as someone who has worked with the IOL for quite some time now I found it unusually spot-on. It clearly plays on the fact that since Africa as a continent and Papua New Guinea as a country contains a VAST amount of linguistic diversity, languages from these areas of the world make for great material for linguistic puzzles.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="background-color: white; color: #323232;">I fully understand that the message was not that we would exclude participants</span><span style="background-color: white; color: #323232;">&nbsp;from these countries on any other basis than "to make it easier for our Problem Committee and Jury". Now, I'll get to why that isn't true later, but first some background to the bias.</span></span></span><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8BQ3RqJQs7A/WXrNXYWt6rI/AAAAAAAAFmI/iCzLl1I_5dAkq1zqplXFtjRY86JBd9XFwCLcBGAs/s1600/583.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><img border="0" data-original-height="256" data-original-width="512" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8BQ3RqJQs7A/WXrNXYWt6rI/AAAAAAAAFmI/iCzLl1I_5dAkq1zqplXFtjRY86JBd9XFwCLcBGAs/s640/583.png" width="640" /></span></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: small;">Map from Worldmapper where the countries size have been scaled to represent the relative number of languages within that country compared to the rest of the world. <br />© Copyright Sasi Group (University of Sheffield) and Mark Newman (University of Michigan).</span></td></tr></tbody></table><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: #323232;">This&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; color: #323232;">satirical</span><span style="color: #323232;">&nbsp;blog post did make me think of the more pertinent and serious issue of </span><span style="background-color: white; color: #323232;">dominance</span><span style="color: #323232;">&nbsp;of European countries. There are reasons for this bias, they're mainly historical, but also in part economical.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">The contest started in Russia and the first international contests were dominated by slavic countries (</span><a href="http://www.ioling.org/history/" style="font-family: inherit;">IOL history is here</a><span style="font-family: inherit;">). The contest later grew to include first non-slavic countries and then non-european countries. The IOL does not run each contest, it's run by local </span>organizers<span style="font-family: inherit;">. This means that it is </span>significantly<span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;harder for developing countries and&nbsp;</span>countries lacking the necessary infrastructure.<br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><b><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">Countries and territories of the IOL</span></b></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">Nowadays, we don't speak of "countries" of the IOL as much as "countries and territories", in order to accurately represent participating delegations like those from Anglo- and Francophone Canada respectively and Isle of Man.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Here is a list of all 43 countries and territories that have partaken at least once: &nbsp;Canada Francophone, France, Israel, Lithuania, Norway, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, Finland, Greece, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Turkey, Germany, Isle of Man, Japan, Spain, Taiwan, Brazil, China, Hungary, Singapore, Canada Anglophone, Czech Republic, Romania, Australia, India, Ireland, UK, Republic of Korea, Slovenia, Serbia, Sweden, USA, Poland , Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Netherlands and Russia.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Of those, 30 have an accredited contest. Meaning, there's a contest in that country or territory that the IOL-board has deemed lives up to our criteria and can receive lower registration fees and participate for more than 2 years.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">The criteria for being accredited are:</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></span><br /><ol style="background-color: white; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: decimal; margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">be a contest that features problems about linguistics or a closely related field</span></div></li><li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: decimal; margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">have a working website that is not excluded from search engine results</span></div></li><li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: decimal; margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">be open to all students up to secondary level in the country (i.e not restricted to certain schools or programmes)</span></div></li><li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: decimal; margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">display clear information about registration and competing well in advance </span></div></li><li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: decimal; margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">have the problem set in the language of the majority of the population or the language of education</span></div></li><li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: decimal; margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">have details on how to contact the contest organizers on the website</span></div></li></ol><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><br /></span><b><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">IOL does not run each contest - the economical problem</span></b></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">In order to understand this situation, you also need to understand that the IOL does <b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration-line: underline;">not </b>directly run each and every national or territory-wide contest. There are separate organisations who do that, they create their own problems and seek their own funding. In order to do this, there needs to be serious enthusiasm and involvement from a group of people and backing from either a non-profit organisation, universities or the ministry of education. On the problem-creating-front, it's worth noting that several national/territory-contest collaborate with each other and share problems.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Contrary to what you might think, we actually often receive messages from people in non-european countries who are not yet part of IOL, but who want to join. They contact us <a href="https://international-linguistics-olympiad.blogspot.com.au/p/contact.html">here</a> and we try and help as best we can.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">There's been messages from Uganda, Egypt, Nigeria, Guatemala, Nepal, Kenya, Malaysia and more countries. We then tell them about what would be needed in order to start up a contest, and most of the time they can't meet those requirements and we lose contact. This is sad, and now you know.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">In particular, the obstacle is often finding the funds to organise a contest that is</span></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;open too all secondary school students of the country/territory (not just one school) and paying the air fares etc for the international contest.</span><br /><br />The economical bit isn't the only factor though, there are countries that partake every year that have lower GDP than some who have never partaken (cough, Italy, cough). There is also the matter of there being hard working volunteers and the infrastructure (support from ministry of education, companies or non-profits).<br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">The Maths Olympiad can, so why can't we?</span></b></span><br /><a href="https://www.imo-official.org/countries.aspx" style="font-family: inherit;">The International Mathematical Olympiad covers 100 countries</a><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;and is in some ways similar to the IOL (though much older). My hope is that we will also become as large. The obstacles we're facing are partly economical, but there's also the fact that linguistics isn't taught as a basic subject in schools. We won't let this </span>deter<span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;us though, we'll keep aiming high and spreading knowledge about languages, linguistics and our olympiad!</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><b><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;"><br /></span></b><b><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: large;">Would the Problem Committee (PC) really prefer that fewer non-european countries join?</span></b></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;">Of course not, I take that as a given.</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">First let's talk about <b>the languages the problems are </b></span><i style="font-family: inherit;"><b>in</b></i><span style="font-family: inherit;">, not </span><i style="font-family: inherit;">about</i><span style="font-family: inherit;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">The PC has in the past shown great talent in scouting out language experts to help with translation of problem sets for the participants (all without the knowledge of the national/territory team leaders or organisers). I have no doubt they can take anything we throw at them. Note that the languages of the IOL need to be dominant or&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">official in the country of the contest, so we are not selecting from all 7,000+ languages of the world.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: white; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: white; white-space: pre-wrap;">For those who might not know: the problem committee does not work with a base version of the problem in English and then translates into the others. They work with a version in a between language Ivan chooses to call "solverese". </span><span style="background-color: white; white-space: pre-wrap;">If you want to read more about multilingual editing of the IOL problems, we propose that you read this paper written by the Ivan:</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br /><div dir="ltr" style="background-color: white; line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #1155cc; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><a href="http://ift.tt/1uRZrJr" style="color: #5887b4; text-decoration-line: none;">Derzhanski, Ivan (2013) Multilingual Editing of Linguistic Problems, In Proceedings of the Fourth Workshop on Teaching NLP and CL August 2013 Sofia, Bulgaria Association for Computational Linguistics 27–34 </a> </span></span><a href="http://anthology.aclweb.org/W/W13/W13-3404.pdf" style="color: #5887b4;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #1155cc; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">http://anthology.aclweb.org/W/W13/W13-3404.pdf</span></a><span style="background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> [in English]</span></span></div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Now to the issue of the <b>language the problems are <i>about,</i></b> rather than <i>in. </i>It is true that the PC seeks to make problems about languages that the contestants are unlikely to know.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>(The closest we've come in the past to the issue of&nbsp;participants&nbsp;knowing the language of the problem must have been when Australia competed and there was a problem in Vietnamese.

Participants of the IOL are not likely to know all of these, even if participants from Africa or PNG would make the scope smaller there's still plenty left.
