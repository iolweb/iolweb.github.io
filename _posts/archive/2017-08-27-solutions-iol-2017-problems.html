There were a lot of slaves taken from this region of Africa to Brazil for forced labour to produce goods for Europe. Brazilian Portuguese is different from European Portuguese, and there is a long discussion on the influence of different African languages on its development. Kimbundu is one of the languages that is believed to have had a significant influence on the development of Brazilian Portuguese.<br /><br /><div style="background-color: white; color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Milena Veneva, author of problem #1 on Birom, has also kindly shared presentation slides. <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-lVFHmduY1WeThsNEFESnFYdmc">You can find those here.</a></span></div><div><br style="background-color: white; color: #323232; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><div style="background-color: white; color: #323232; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; text-align: center;"><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; padding: 4px; position: relative; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OT-JCSOqK8c/VIV2J9P1SPI/AAAAAAAADF8/9qftUPQfAA8/s1600/africa.png" style="color: #17507c; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-decoration-line: none;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OT-JCSOqK8c/VIV2J9P1SPI/AAAAAAAADF8/9qftUPQfAA8/s1600/africa.png" style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-size: initial; border-radius: 0px; border: 1px solid rgb(203, 203, 203); box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 0px 0px 0px; padding: 8px; position: relative;" width="341" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="font-size: 10.4px;">Languages of Africa, based on Ethnologue.

Nigeria is one of the most linguistically diverse countries on the planet, it is estimated that over 500 languages are spoken there! Atlantic-Congo* is the largest language family in the world, with over 1,400 members!</div><div><br /></div><div>For more information on how people did solving these two problems, insights from the authors etc, please see the presentation slides :)!</div><div><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: x-small;">*There are two different names for this family, you might be more familiar with "Niger-Congo" than "Atlantic-Congo". They are different, and have different members. It all depends on how far back you believe that you can reconstruct this family. Glottolog is more conservative and uses "Atlantic-Congo", while Ethnologue is more inclusive and uses the label "Niger-Congo". One of the largest differences in the members of these two groups is whether or not to include Mande languages. "Niger-Congo" includes Mande, but "Atlantic-Congo" does not include Mande languages. Both of these labels include Bantu languages, the largest subgroup with over 600 languages.</span></div></div>
