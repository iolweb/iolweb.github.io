From the Local Organizing Committee of the 18th IOL

Due to these unpredictable times and taking into account safety measures applied in Latvia, IOL 2021 will be held remotely, with no teams able to attend in person.
The exact amount of participation fees and registration deadlines will be determined in a week or two.

We thank you for the patience and look forward to having you online with us on July 19-23, when one of the most exciting events of the summer will take place! Opening and closing ceremonies will be streamed online, but for the individual and team competitions, teams must meet in a single location and will be invigilated by a person appointed by the Jury.
