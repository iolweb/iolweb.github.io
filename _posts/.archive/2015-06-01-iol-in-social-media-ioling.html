<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">The International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL) is on social media, you're most welcome to follow us and post about us! There's a hashtag that you can use when posting in social media, #ioling (just &nbsp;like our website <a href="http://ioling.org/">ioling.org</a>).<br /><div><br /></div>Right now we have several social media outlets, both for the IOL in general and for this years event in Bulgaria in particular. &nbsp;You can follow the&nbsp;<a href="http://international-linguistics-olympiad.blogspot.com.au/">IOL blog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/IntLingOlympiad">twitter</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/international.linguistics.olympiad">our facebook-page</a>. You can write to us at all these places, and in <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ueMf7C438bn7YqYftqQ-xlPpnzuaWjRHpe4xVo4oUMI/viewform">this contact form</a>. You can also keep track of <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/search/ioling">the hashtag ioling on tumblr</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ioling">youtube</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ioling?src=hash">on twitter</a>&nbsp;and of course also use it yourself when posting about linguistic olympiads.<br /><br />For this years event in particular - the 13th International Linguistics Olympiad which takes place in Bulgaria in July 2015 -&nbsp;<a href="http://iol13.linguistics-bg.com/">you can also visit the excellent website</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/iol13?fref=ts">follow it on Facebook</a>&nbsp;for more specific news about this year.<br /><br />We haven't yet started regularly posting on Instagram, but of course the hashtag can be used there too. There are also more Facebook-groups for participants from certain years or other kinds of friendly gatherings, have a look around and/or start a new if you'd like.<br /><br />For those who might need a quick little introduction to send to friends, I highly recommend this short video:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Fu44oJqDjI/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Fu44oJqDjI?feature=player_embedded" width="500"></iframe></div><br />All the best,<br />IOL-board member Hedvig<br /><br />p.s&nbsp;<a href="http://international-linguistics-olympiad.blogspot.com.au/2015/05/support-your-local-linguistic-olympiad.html">If you are a linguist or are in contact with linguists who might be interested in being involved in puzzle idea brainstorms, please send them to this blog post.</a></div>
