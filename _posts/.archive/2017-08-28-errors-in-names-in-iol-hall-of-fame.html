<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="font-family: inherit;">Lately we've had several people point out problems in <a href="http://www.ioling.org/hall_of_fame/">the Hall of Fame of IOL, the page that tracks rare&nbsp;</a><span style="background-color: white;"><a href="http://www.ioling.org/hall_of_fame/">achievements among contestants and teams.</a> &nbsp;These errors always stem from multiple versions of the name of a given person. For example, one year a contestant has been listed with all middle names and another year with only the name of address. Our database of results is not able to understand that this is the same person, and therefore the person does not appear in the Hall of Fame.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: white;">If you have won more than one medal, or if all the members of your team won a medal in the individual, and your name is not listed in the Hall of Fame -<a href="http://international-linguistics-olympiad.blogspot.com.au/p/contact.html"> please let us know</a>.</span></span></div>
